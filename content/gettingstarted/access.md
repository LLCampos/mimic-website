# Requesting access

The latest version of MIMIC is MIMIC-III, which comprises over 58,000 hospital admissions for 38,645 adults and 7,875 neonates. The data spans June 2001 - October 2012. The database, although de-identified, still contains detailed information regarding the clinical care of patients, so must be treated with appropriate care and respect. 

Researchers seeking to use the database must formally request access with the steps below:

- Follow [the instructions](https://physionet.org/pnw/login) to create and log in to a PhysioNetWorks account. If you already have a PhysioNetWorks account, [log in to it](https://physionet.org/pnw/login).
- On your PhysioNetWorks project page, click on the link titled "[MIMIC-III Clinical Database](https://physionet.org/works/MIMICIIIClinicalDatabase/)", and follow the instructions to apply for access.

When your application has been approved you will receive emails containing instructions for downloading the database from PhysioNetWorks. Approval may take several business days, and will be delayed if your request is missing any required information or if you have not completed the required CITI training.
